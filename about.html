              <h1>NatureEQ</h1>
              <p class="lead"><b>NatureEQ</b> is an educational organization designed to help people re-connect with the beauty and vitality of the natural world. Our underlying philosophy, supported by scientific research, is that sustaining a deep connection with nature is fundamental for human health and well-being.<br><br>

                Research has shown that time spent mindfully engaging with nature is very effective for increasing resilience, decreasing stress, boosting creativity and improving memory and cognitive function. Contact with the natural world has also been shown to improve physical health through reducing inflammation, and supporting the body’s natural healing process.<br>
                
                At Nature in mind we run workshops, courses, tours, and retreats that show people how to mindfully engage with nature in a deep and sustained way,techniques and exercises to help you get the most benefit for your mind and body out of your contact with the natural world.<br><br>
                
                Through working with us you will learn to use the natural world as a resource to help support you in stress management and improving the overall quality of your life. This can be done by learning ways to connect with nature on a daily basis that provide mental and physical nourishment.
                
                By consciously engaging with nature we naturally develop emotional connections with life that motivate us to care for our local environments and develop a kinship with all living things. Through our interactions with nature we cultivate generosity, care, kindness, and compassion for the world around us which naturally boosts our own happiness too.
                
                Research shows that mindfulness can help to increase focus and attention, increase positive emotion, improve physical health, and decrease stress. Therefore, a mindfulness-based approach to the natural world is a powerful combination that can dramatically improve your health and well-being by mindfully digesting regular doses of vitamin ‘N’.</p>
